# Hi there, I'm Jeff

<!-- <p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  Take a look at <span style="font-weight: bold">[[Your first seed]]</span> to get started on your exploration.

<!-- My latest project is [Clearful](https://clearful.com) (launching soon), a digital journal that helps you get the most out of life.

I built Clearful with my co-founder [Maria](https://mariagolikova.com), whom I also founded [Mealime](https://mealime.com) with in 2013. Mealime was acquired in 2018.

Since early 2019 I've been learning to code and have (so far) built Clearful apps almost entirely myself. I write here about the programming lessons I'm learning, interesting books and articles I've read, ideas I'm pondering, and publish notes in the digital garden style.

Please feel free to say hello on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeffreybunn) or email me. I love meeting new people and am always up for a coffee if you're ever in Vancouver, BC. And don't forget to subscribe to my occasional newsletter below! -->
